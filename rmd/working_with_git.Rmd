# Introduction

Version control software is a powerful tool for tracking progress when conducting data analyses, 
either when working alone or in teams.

should use version control software, most notably Git and GitHub.  
This document will attempt to both describe the Git workflow as we will be implementing
it and serve as a tutorial for users who are still getting up to speed.

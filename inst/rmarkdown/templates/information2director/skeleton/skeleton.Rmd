# Summary

This is summarizes an interesting memo.

# Analysis

This is where we describe the subject matter.  We can hard code specific numbers, like the average temperature was `r mean(pressure$temperature) %>% round()`.  We can also include plots as follows in Figure \@ref(fig:fig1).

```{r fig1, fig.cap = 'Relationship between Pressure and Temperature'}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlab('Temperature') + 
  ylab('Pressure') + 
  theme_bw()
```
